{"text": " you you you you you you you you you ladies and gentlemen welcome to the first question and half an hour that's a is that for the process clear that is the case then I give it first as the first word to Mr. van drofelaar municipal interests thank you chairman our question is about a decision in the reading order doubts an inhabitant about a construction plan within the rules of a decision-making plan or without permission can be executed well that kind of questions then there is the possibility of information informant informant information we found that in the time so important that this decision has also been made in the reading order we recently received at an internal discussion hearing that yes the possibility is simply created and we would regret it very much if it is indeed so is today our question of is it correct our assumption that the conversation is created that is the reason for this and if our assumption is correct when this is the you you you you you you you you you thank you chairman Mr. van drofelaar I can be very short and no that can be still at the same time your story can still be true so I hear very much like where that comes from because that is not how both the ODR and we ourselves because that is also a place where people can be right with these kinds of questions where that is wrong because that is not how it should be then you might have to think about a written answer together with the colleague Gert-Jan Keller this was necessary at an internal consultation with one of the board of directors where a number of officials were also given so please give a written answer here agreement yes comes a written answer then I give the floor to Mrs. Hoek municipality interests thank you chairman I have the question or we have the question asked about the safety crosspoint connection road to the sport park de Maurik the crosspoint there is now used by the students of the two primary schools the new building district and it is true that there safety in the law that it is not clear so our question is actually what is the state of affairs with relevant research on traffic safety and at what time can we actually expect our residents to be measured thank you ms. Hoek I give the floor to the board of directors thank you chairman yes that indeed applies to a measure that should be carried out in the short term within the gvp is that term within four years at the moment an advisory board is busy studying a number of variants and yes it is the intention that the crosspoint is improved and the missing road towards the provincial road is also being laid out expectation is that we will come up with a final design this year and depending on the chosen design and the cost of realization, a plan can be made for implementation thank you chairman I would also be able to receive this written because the permission to then this year to get the budget and next year probably realization I would like to write then or is that already happening anyway yes in itself the answer is if you are satisfied with the answer the answer is a nod and that is the permission yes thank you thank you then I give the floor to Mr. Van laar municipality of blanke thank you chairman to spend on local entrepreneurs in the public space it does not work despite permissions to spend on work and to spend on local entrepreneurs these companies are not being approached either by the Avri and not by the municipality the question is whether the municipality will certainly take the responsible legislator into action in the short term so that this will work thank you I give the floor to legislator mayer responsibility thank you chairman the integral management of public space in our municipality is spent on the gha avri and a large part of the activities are carried out by people with a distance to the labor market with which a social interest is served another part of the activities are spent by avri by entrepreneurs where local companies enjoy the opportunity so there are under house contracts closed with renowned regional parties Avri, meanwhile, delivers the e-board services to the three municipalities and a number of services are bought in combined with the eye on scale enlargement and cost savings due to the scope of these contracts, the threshold value is often exceeded here, which makes this work public to be spent and then regional parties get competition from national and sometimes even European companies thank you legislator mayer enough Mr. van laar not satisfied but enough for this moment thank you then I go to the fourth question of tonight Mr. van blijderveen vvd yes thank you chairman on August 31 the municipality of the college received a flitz message about the wind park Echtelt-Lien-de the vvd is very shocked by the added report of the meeting of the steering group of June 28 from the report it turns out that the steering group has decided to continue with the MERS research with understanding of the northern part of the search area here mayer is in fact enlarged the search area and a neighborhood council decision denied our group finds this totally unacceptable we then also have the following question to the college the steering group has decided to continue with the MERS research until more clarity is made about the status of our amendment can the college indicate what exactly is unclear about the decisions that the neighborhood council has taken regarding the rest of the 1.0 and the corresponding search areas the steering group is closing a considerable role and appears to make decisions according to its own report in how far the steering group is able to decide to put down a decision made by the municipality council and finally in how far the college of plan to agree with the wish of the steering group to want to adjust a democratically established search area for so far my questions thank you thank you Mr. van blijderveen I give the floor to the legislator on the bass thank you thank you very much the questions you asked were of course also the questions we had on June 28 was the last meeting of the previous deputies and it is the deputies as mentioned before to make that decision about the scope of the MERS plan so not the steering group the steering group has made no objection to that in the majority the amendment is under the under the attention of the province and the new deputies has indicated that they that amendment that they see no reason to deviate from that amendment because it has come to stand in a democratic way and that they will want to commit to it but at the same time also want to explore the entire area but with the final commitment to keep in mind the decision to keep in mind the established search area thank you the law keeps the question clear not necessary thank you then I go to the fifth question Mrs. Arendts party of the arnhart gondlings yes thank you chairman my first question is the next at the beginning of this year there was a annoying situation around the without permission of grasslands in the Weidevogel area and then agreed not to hand over this year to make time to come to a workable agreement for all parties and my question is what is the state of affairs with other words how far is the municipality with coming to such a workable agreement thank you mrs. Arendts I give the floor to the legal mayor for answer yes thank you chairman it is correct indeed mrs. Arendts we have earlier this year we talked about this and that is correct what you say at parties with the indication Weidevogel area is a permit required for certain activities such as planting trees or cutting grasslands without a permit that is not allowed there is only a permit if the research shows that the activities in the Weidevogel area are not permanently unevenly damaged as it says in the plan at the beginning of the year we received a report from the foundation of the environmental work group that a violation of this ban is taking place on a number of parcels I think of the conversion from grassland to field without permission in those cases there is a speech of tearing grasslands after the occasion of this report we saw a letter sent to the involved parcel owners about this permit requirement by now in agreement with representatives of the agricultural sector the environmental work group province and ODR a research going to the explanation of the relevant plan rules about the permit and the exception for exchange rates we expect at the end of the year a definitive can take points of view about this yes about the situation yes thank you I give you the floor again but now it is about the offer to permanent recreation has the word thank you the question is the following in the vision of recreation and tourism is it is noted that there is little diversity in the offer to permanent recreation and we see at this moment mainly a tendency to apply parks with quite expensive recreation homes sometimes at the expense of other cheaper forms of permanent recreation our question to the college is what is in the vision of the college the limit to the number of luxury recreation parks in the municipalities from that we strive for a diverse offer and how is this sent to thank you then I request again the law keeps me standing up for responsibility in my opinion you can also stay like that stand that is but chairman you know that at my age it is very good to move a bit yes then I'll do that okay yes I'm going to give you a bit of a formal answer because you yourself have a number of policy pieces already established that simply point out here because every request is of course tested on the plan and the surrounding vision and they are here in your council established and by now we also have a vision of recreation and tourism and that is important because it gives what our ambition is in it and that is also tested so at the moment that it is a request that outside the framework of the vision recreation tourism falls yes then you can ask if you want to continue with that so I think that it is true that both the test is taking place in terms of plan and the surrounding vision and economically the vision of recreation and tourism thank you you have a follow-up question here on the I have a follow-up question but I already ask it personally excellent thank you then I give you also the word for the seventh question of tonight Mrs. Arends status recreation housing that is really the last promise the question is as far as we know for marina park bad nederrein former loswal still that the recreation housing between october and april must be removed where is this indeed still correct and so yes what is the municipality going to do to prevent that the houses will remain this year again because of the length of the handling procedure thank you the lawmaker yes thank you chairman yes against the intended violation was committed last season with a burden on the compulsion despite that the handling decision is not completed then a compulsion is committed that will be introduced by the contractor then a new burden is imposed and the contractor has a longer working time with a much higher compulsion of a maximum of 625,000 euros in connection with handling by the state of rijkswater the terms are now agreed that the agreement is now from 31 october the relevant accommodations are to be removed on the half-yearly 31 october otherwise a compulsion of 5,000 euros per transaction per accommodation the accommodations are to be removed until 1 march then wel 1 april depending on the location and the cadastral parcels thank you enough mv arents thank you we are the mayor then i go to the mr. van de ik cda chairman thank you given the time we are over half of the number of questions and we are not yet half of the time so I think I can do it slowly my first question there are three underground or semi-underground containers placed next to the village house the aversaad in church aversaad and the board and the authorities are very concerned about the placement of the containers and not so much about the placement of the containers but what is going to happen on it for example dump dumpings they are also concerned about smell pollution of the incontinence material and actually I have the concrete question the initiators of the placement of these containers can again go into conversation with the manager and the board to also explain the situation they would like to hear again have heard of why necessarily on this place and why not on other places I have read the pieces and that turns out that it really is the right place in that sense but yes there are also some concerns and I think that with a conversation that that concern can be taken out of the sky so that is my first question thank you thank you very much I give the floor to the lawmaker the bass yes thank you very much chairman yes this this file knows a long time and you just referred to mr. van dyk at church aversaad new containers had to be placed because the previous locations turned out to be quite unfortunate and also after extensive research also repeated extensive research this location turned out to be the only one that was most appropriate there has been contact at different times with the board of the village house and yes actually the positions did not get much closer together they are also informed about the final decision that the council saw in this case the daily board of the avery has taken to actually take the decision to actually place the procedures there recently the vision procedure has been completed there too the board has introduced a vision that has not led to changing insights they have also had a reaction and now actually the only procedure that would still be in the way of the actual placement the way to the council of states but I hope that is not necessary with the actual adjustment that I checked this morning contact is made with the environment that is also said to them to see how that can be adapted so that the burden can be reduced to a minimum but then it must be effective also to that location can be passed so that is the state of affairs thank you thank you the order was sufficient so Mr. van Dijk I give you the space for the next question question 9 of tonight yes thank you and I will follow the list of what I have received the second question or the second question is about picking up the old paper with everyone is now known that the avery will pick up the old paper itself the relevant associations or parties because they are also church institutions have had a conversation during the holiday period with the legislator who talks about it and they then received the commitment that there would be a follow-up in September so actually my first question is this agreement has already been made and my follow-up question if that is not the case these associations can then be informed this month so that the agreement can be made that there is still a reaction this month come it can also be that it will be November but that is actually the follow-up question thank you the order the bass yes thank you very much chairman indeed there was a conversation on July 18 with a number of associations that pick up old paper everyone was invited but indeed for some it was also holiday time so not everyone was there there was a conversation with associations about for their acceptable alternatives there is currently a discussion notice of development that comes to your council on October 10 to discuss what you see as flexible alternatives and on October 12 the decision will be made by the general board of the Avri and then there can be a conversation about the concrete the implementation of that process is also shared but from your reaction I understand that that did not come across completely so we will confirm that again to the paper association is what I call them thank you Mr. Van Dijk yes that the third question is about transformation houses and there are a number of transformation houses in the municipality neighbors who are about to be replaced they are too old there can be nothing done with it and then it is logical that a new one is placed and the new ones are then placed on another alternative location only when you come to drive in a wheel then you look at the beautiful village house and there you look at a yes you can find it beautiful or not beautiful but you get a green building and it is actually a bit against the very leg of the board of the village house foundation in the exxonest because they are totally not are involved you go on vacation and that is a nice view you come back from vacation and there is a green house and there are actually concrete questions how the house is on municipality ground is there no consultation with the board of the foundation is that correct this assumption and is there a reason for this and the subsequent question would be that house can still be moved nothing is done with it and yes five meters further up it actually comes out much better those are the questions thank you thank you also the lawmaker de bas yes thank you very much chairman I think it's good to just sketch the process for the placement of a transformer house is not a decision-making change is necessary there is in principle in every decision-making plan space for adding a utility facility such as the transformer house process is so that liander determines the place and that is also because they have certain conditions for the placement of such a house there must be a certain infrastructure can be set up because all technical things where I have no understanding but liander fortunately they determine the place then indicate this at the ODR and when it comes to municipality ground then test that at the municipality or the place is accessible and that is in the general process how that specifically in this case has gone I do not know so there we will be written you have to come back but this is just generally seen the process so it is not so that there is a procedure is missing or something I do understand a written follow-up on this answer Mr. Van Dijk if I may ask a short follow-up question because it is then so because I understand that it is as it is but is it indeed so that it is just without important or direct residents there not with at least not report that it comes there it is a sufficient fact is that then usually that it works like that or strictly speaking if you can build without permission then that would work like that but I do not know in all honesty how that is organized in this process so that is part of the answer of your question thank you then I give the floor to Mr. Van Dijk yes chairman thank you we are still in time so yes I have a subject about traffic safety in the neighborhood if you drive from Tiel to the neighborhood then you come to a split Tielseweg out Tielseweg in the neighborhood a sidewalk and that sidewalk is a bit white marked but there are still many cars that crash there with the result of clasping tires sometimes two broken tires and then those cars come as a rattle to a halt yes in a fence on a residential area or a residential area and it is still a dangerous traffic situation the concrete questions in this part are of is it part of the road where it is about of the municipality or is it a provincial road and if it is a road of the municipality is there anything else to be done with traffic safety and if it is a road of the province can the municipality neighbors then at the province to push that there is something done with traffic safety thank you thank you the law had me you can answer on the white marked sidewalk tires not so clearly chairman but the questions that have been asked are more about the has its own situation then it is a common road or is it a provincial road even in the built-in com it is still a provincial road so the N834 is a provincial road also in the neighborhood so that means that the management and the maintenance are at the province so yes we can do nothing about that to regulate measures last week we got that message here too that there were calamities and we have also made direct contact with the province and made this known the province has already signed that they are with us about this in go and look at the situation so I don't know if that is enough I can't answer that but there is certainly a follow-up thank you the law had me I see that is enough answer Mr. van Dijk then I give for the twelfth question the floor to Mr. de Lange PCG thank you chairman more than half a year ago the official report came out that we the bridge between Linden and Rene would be widened after that we actually heard nothing about it my first question here is how is the state of affairs about it the consequences of the municipality neighbors who will have to do the permit do go out is known when the start of the permit is asked and the last question is the municipality then ready for thank you Mr. de Lange I give the word to the lawmaker major thank you chairman yes Mr. de Lange we were of course all very happy that the decision was taken that indeed both provinces were so far that they wanted to spend money on it and the flag went out then both provinces are still very busy to get enough water so that there is actually a plan is made to widen the bridge so far it is at this moment not yet yes now the next question of when we are going to do that work activities then are being captured that is only when all three parties are so far that they say but a plan have a final design then we can only continue so there it is a bit and your last question is the municipality ready for a possible permit request certainly we do that together with the ODR but the municipality is ready for that thank you very much we have a clear question here the long yes yes I have a clear note it takes so for a while yes that is your conclusion I do not immediately have the tendency to share that I think that the economic interest of the extension of the Rhine bridge is just tested every day in the area it will come to that I suspect very honestly said that by the change of administration at the different provinces maybe one of the attention has been missed I hope not to be honest but I really go from it that this is still being taken up by the provinces and that we indeed quickly something to be seen but again our influence is really too limited to say more about it now thank you very much mayor well a big compliment to you all 12 questions within half an hour excellent and I think still questions can ask and answer and a big compliment to the mayor of the city and mayor of the city mayor of the majority of the answers actually comes to the consideration of the councilor Neven who unfortunately can not be present tonight so thank you all in a few minutes the council meeting you", "segments": [{"id": 0,
