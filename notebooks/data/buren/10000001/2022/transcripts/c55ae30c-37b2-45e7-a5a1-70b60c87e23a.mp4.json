{"text": " There are still some people who may come in to look for a seat. The very last people who are looking for a seat. It is half past eight. I am opening this very special council meeting. Today, June 7, 2022. An important day for many people. Welcome everyone. Welcome home. Take a look at the camera. It's nice that you are here too. And welcome to the audience. Family, friends, acquaintances, other people from the municipality, citizens council members. It's nice that you are all here. A special welcome tonight to the newly appointed legislators. Mrs. de Bas, Mr. Meijer, Mr. Neven and Mrs. Betink. It's nice that you are here. Two there and two in the audience. Also a special welcome to the outgoing legislators. Andre van der Hurk and Nico Wiendels in the audience. It's nice that you are here. And then there are two other people who will be appointed tonight. That is Mr. Van Blijderveen as council member. And Mr. Van der Sluis as citizen council member. Both for the CDA. It turns out that this will be a very special meeting. We are not going to discuss parts. We are going to discuss one part, a very important part. The coalition agreement. But no ideas in the sense that you are all going to find something. You are going to talk about votes later. But it will be a different kind of evening. We are going to appoint people. We are going to finish the dinner. We will all experience that later. There are still people coming in, so it's nice that you are here. I'm looking for a place. We have received one appointment for tonight. Mr. de Jonge for the Party for the Animals. Unfortunately, he cannot be present. We understand that and we hope that Mr. de Jonge can follow the meeting tonight. We are now with 20 council members. Let's take a look around. Why is there an empty chair? There is too much chair there. That's for the unexpected guest. Yes, yes, yes. We haven't heard that. We don't respond to that. Then we go to the resolution of the agenda tonight. That is agenda 2 on your agenda and in IBABS. I did not say that, but tonight people can also follow the meeting via the site and watch the parts. Other people can follow all the parts via our own internal mailbag. Tonight's agenda. The council agenda is also not useful. There are no useful points. The parts can be done at a certain point, but we do not have a question quarter. We do not have information from work groups at the end. That is not all. You are asked to determine the agenda as suggested, where I have one comment. At the council decision, what tonight, one council decision. That is about different parts, you may have seen. Decisions have been made in the one council decision. Decisions 1-6 are made by the coalition negotiators. I will bring you through it, so you don't have to look. Decisions 1-6 are made by the coalition negotiators. Decisions 7 and 8, which are about the naming and approval of the new council members, are made by the GRFI. I will bring you through it. It is one council decision, but you can see that different parts are submitted by different people. You can vote with this. We can determine the agenda like this. Then that happened. Then I will go straight to the meeting pieces. I will also introduce them briefly, but then I will quickly give the floor to the formatter. Three parties, two municipalities, neighbors, PCG neighbors and CDA neighbors have had talks, as you all know, and they have led to a preliminary agreement. You have all contributed to this, and I think that is beautiful. I have been able to experience the process from the beginning, and I have seen that you have all been able to have talks with each other as a whole council and that you have also been able to have talks with the negotiating parties at the end of the trip. I would like to give a compliment in advance, because I think that is a beautiful result. You will continue to discuss the content, but this was just the process as it has been. Then the talks have also led to a proposal for the formation of a new college. So four legislators will be presented for the call tonight. Then I now give the floor to Mr. Van Alfen as a formatter, and he will take us along. Are you going to do that here or there? Yes, that seems good to me. He will take us along in the process and in the content of the agreement. And then, as I understand it, Mr. Van Alfen will also give the contribution of municipal interests to the agreement. Huijgaard. Thank you, chairman. That indeed seems just as practical to me. As the chairman just indicated, I would like to first make the council proposal, the following process and the coalition agreement from my own experience as a formatter. And then I will give a reaction as a group chairman of municipal interests neighbors on this agreement. On April 12, the informant chief of each presented his advice, in which he advised a coalition between municipal interests neighbors, PCG neighbors and CDA neighbors to further explore. He also gave the advice to include the content of the other parties in this discussion. He advised to use the knowledge and expertise within the organization and to regularly evaluate the coalition agreement to find points or to add if necessary. During this meeting, I was appointed as a formatter. I would like to thank Mr. Van Elk again for his important role in the entire process to come to the coalition agreement and the appointment of a new college. After this advice, I went to work with Monique Betting of the CDA and Erik Saarje of the PCG. I have also agreed to first ask for the input from the non-forming parties, to have a conversation with the mayor and to hear from the organization what wishes and challenges there are. In addition, parties have already indicated the wish that there would be no close-knit detailed coalition agreement. Finally, it was the explicit wish of the three parties that the agreement is realistic and realistic, that not everything you want can be done and that certainly not everything can be done at the same time. There was also an application made to the non-forming parties, which was asked to give points that should be included in the formation. All parties have used this. Some have sent their points by email, others have discussed this in a conversation with us. We also had a first conversation with the mayor to get input. After that, there have been talks with the organization, in which the head of the department is asked what developments are expected to come in the coming time. It is also asked to enter the previous coalition agreement with the question of which points have not yet been fully realized. After this inventory, we started to negotiate in detail. These talks have taken place from the beginning in a good atmosphere and on a constructive basis. The parties have introduced their wishes and important starting points, on which each theme has been discussed well with each other and on which agreements have been made. The most important agreement that has been made is perhaps that not everything is closed and that the parties do not want this. The agreement must be as much as possible an agreement on guidelines. An agreement in which agreements are made on how, as a council, we would like to work together. How we can give each party, coalition or opposition as much space as possible to be themselves. Of course, a number of concrete issues have been agreed on and you agree on them. But you mainly find things that need to be addressed in the coming years. So you find the agreement to discuss various city notes in the council. But not which direction those city notes should go. That is up to the council and not the coalition parties. The talks we have held have led to an agreement entitled Together for the Future. It is mainly a headline agreement consisting of the five chapters. In the invitation letter we wrote the following about it. The chapter Modern Board. We are committed to a good cooperation with residents, entrepreneurs and social organizations. We want to take new steps and work together with the council in a new way. The next chapter Future Vision of Neighbors. The future profile is leading in our policy formation in the coming years. We will also further develop the profile in a plan. The next chapter is Core Directive 2.0. We have already achieved many results in the past period. We will work on further development of core directives in the core and within our organization. The next chapter is the physical environment. We carry out social tasks in terms of housing and sustainability. At the same time, we also have beautiful landscapes, recreation and tourism. And the main social domain. We want all residents to be able to participate as well as possible. We are putting emphasis on prevention and we are stimulating a healthy lifestyle. The agreement has been financially calculated and controlled by the organization to be achievable. The agreements have also been put in place as much as possible in time. This will allow the council to further get a grip on the long-term planning of the council. This is a broad-based wish of all political parties. Each chapter contains a number of clear agreements that can be evaluated by the council. This is also the last advice of the informants. At the same time, the agreement is also agreed upon by the new college. The portfolios are divided into five main modes. The mayor and four legislators. Based on the main mode, the parties have chosen candidates. The exact portfolio division is the capacity of the same college of mayors and legislators. This will then also be discussed and established by the college. It is good to note that enthusiastic and driven candidates are ready to lead our beautiful municipalities. They are looking forward to the new way of working that is heard from the previous agreement. Waiting takes a long time. I know from experience that waiting for a possible agreement for non-forming parties has been a long time. That is why I have tried to keep the council as high as possible during formal meetings and by email. In addition, I have been in touch with various council members on the progress over the past few months. After the first concept of the agreement was reached, we sent this to the non-forming parties. They responded to our request and asked if we needed to have a conversation with them about the concept agreement. Two parties have used this. We made the same request to the mayor and also had a conversation with her about the concept agreement. After the introduction of these discussions, a number of adjustments have been made to the concept agreement. We will perhaps have found them. I would like to thank these parties and especially the mayor for their constructive consideration. From this point on, I would like to thank the municipal organization for all the help and support we have been given in writing this agreement. Without shortening people, a special thank you to the board of trustees Kees van der Zaken, Piers Sluijters, Annelieke van Aker, secretary Michiel van Dalen and local secretary Jan Derkse. During all the holidays in recent periods, the already existing full agenda of the council and the development of drugs in our municipalities, we have regularly had to negotiate on Saturdays. We have therefore taken away a lot of your weekends. Thank you for being there. At the moment, there is an agreement with which the council can proceed in the coming years. An agreement with which a new college can proceed. An agreement in which agreements have been made, but in which a lot of things are not mentioned. Not because these matters are not important, but precisely because the forming parties think that no agreements should be made about this in coalition. That these themes are free to the council. That there are multiple possibilities. An agreement that provides space for initiative from all parties within the council. An agreement on which I am proud as a forming party. I thank the parties for the trust I have received to be able to do my work as a forming party. I have enjoyed this important assignment to the council. Now I take a sip of water and I will respond as chairman of the council of council members. After the election in March, we as council members were more than ever aware that there was an important responsibility on our shoulders. And if we did not pay attention to that, we were reminded by others. And that's good. We like to bear this responsibility. We are proud that after the election we were allowed to take the lead in information and then the formation path. For our party, it was important in the negotiations that our beginnings will sound good in a possible agreement. Working in the core direction. Accepting and coercing that the core may differ from each other. That the inhabitants are central and that the power of society must be used optimally. That the inhabitants should feel heard, seen and recognized. That we would like to keep our municipalities independent. In addition, an important starting point was an important point of view for our future vision, which we established in the previous period. In the end, it was certainly our wish that things had to change in the municipal politics. We as council have taken a path together. And we would like to continue that path. More cooperation. As council, more forward. More space for political debate about the matter that is really about. Less agenda driven and more space for everyone's qualities. Chairman, you can imagine that we are very happy with the upcoming agreement. And I would like to highlight a few highlights that are very important for our group. First of all, of course, the main core work. As you all know, core work is very important for our group. What we have started in recent years, we must evolve and develop. Increase the sustainability budgets and set up core agendas together with the inhabitants. A second, extremely important point for municipal interest is the construction of housing. In the agreement, we agree that at least 600 homes will be realized or will be realized in the next four years. Minimum. Where we provide space for flexible and new housing forms. Building for our residents. Extremely important. A third, very important point for municipal interest neighbors is the social domain. And further investing in prevention. Municipal interest is convinced that only by investing in prevention, the costs for the social domain can be pressed on a long term basis. And that is why we want to make even more efforts to move, make even more efforts to play and make even more efforts to recreate. I can't read out many more points from the agreement tonight, which we are very happy with, but we are not going to do that today. We will be discussing all these topics and agreements in the coming time here in the Council. And we look at it as a group. On behalf of municipal interest neighbors, Gert-Jan Keller and I have held the in-depth talks with the PCG and the CDA. We would like to thank our colleagues from the CDA and the PCG for the pleasant atmosphere during these talks. And the respect we have received for our points of view. We are proud of the result. And municipal interest neighbors are also proud that we can present two legislators in the new college. Namely, Martine de Bas and Carl Meijer. Governors who are underscribing our beginnings and enthusiastic to work out the new coalition agreement. Governors who are not afraid to work in the new way. Because this also asks something of a governor. At a next decision I will propose to them and I will give an explanation why we present them. A new college will also say goodbye to a previous one. We would like to thank Nico Wiendels and Andr\u00e9 van der Hulck for their efforts in recent years. And for the pleasant way we have been able to work together. On June 16 we will be further quiet at their departure. But above all, about our own law, Andr\u00e9. Thank you very much for your drivenness and your passion. For the quick-release of permanent files. For your humor and for everything you have done for the municipal neighbors, but also for municipal interest neighbors. We would also like to congratulate Monique Betting and Pieter Neven with their proposal. We look forward to the collaboration with the new college and have all confidence that they can further roll out our agreement. But municipal neighbors are also looking forward to the other way of working in the municipal council in the coming years. I personally believe that the traditional coalition versus opposition thinking is no longer of this time. That this old-fashioned thinking must and can change in the coming years. And that this is also of great importance for the trust of our inhabitants in democracy. Does this mean that you as a party do not have to make compromises? No, I don't think so. Compromises are inherent in politics, even for the largest party in the local municipal council. But what does this mean? That means listening to each other more, keeping your own standpoint well against the light and providing enough space for targeted resident participation. Debate with each other on the front of policy and can differ with each other in opinion. For example, through start-up notifications. With respect for everyone's role, working together with the college. But also respecting each other's opinions and trying to get each other to agree. The outcome of the collectively established point on the horizon, the future vision of the municipal neighbors. This is a challenge for all of us and will not always be easy. But I am convinced that we as the municipal council of neighbors can do this. Together, together for the neighbors of tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you, Mr Van Alsen. You spoke on behalf of the municipalities and your group completely agrees with that. Yes, that's nice. That is the floor for Mr. Zajer of the PCG. You can go. Thank you, Madam Speaker. An agreement that has provided input to several groups and has been able to do so. In which all groups will recognize themselves with matters that are of importance to each other as a council. And where there is enough space for political companies, something that we as representatives of the people have called for. And that we show our residents and entrepreneurs that we as politicians are looking for the best for them. That is ultimately what it is about. And of course there are a number of matters that we as a coalition have agreed on. We did that more than two years ago. With the result that the voters of neighbors have now also valued that in their vote. The PCG is still happy with this agreement. With which we can work together for the next four years. We recognize ourselves as PCG well by the agreements recorded in the agreement. And especially to think, which the PCG finds very important, of strengthening the family. Subsidies for mills, cultural mills in our municipalities. I am not talking about windmills, there is another discussion on the ground. But also, if I look at the limitation of shopping malls, core-oriented. Also a very important point for the PCG. We have had the conversations with the CDA and the municipality as a constructive experience. Honest, respectful and also substantive. And with more than sufficient space for interaction and cooperation with the other parties. That was always our starting point. There will be political differences and they will remain. And that's how it should be. And our voters are also entitled to see and hear these. But let's be especially focused on finding the similarities with each other. And thus achieve the best for our residents and entrepreneurs. In addition, we see a professional and partly experienced and motivated college ready. What we also want to congratulate with that. To go to battle with us as a council together for the next four years. To achieve the best for our municipality. And as the last chairman, we conclude with the words that our formulator has already mentioned. And that is the enormous thanks and appreciation that we want to express for the organization. With all the commitment and involvement, but also certainly the professionalism that they have experienced during the negotiations. Thank you. Thank you. I can say on behalf of the organization, thank you for these beautiful words. Because no one from the organization will react to that, of course. But I am very happy that it has been experienced. The floor is on the CDA, Mr. Peter van Dijk, chairman of the group. Go ahead. Thank you, chairman. For me, today is actually a new role. I had to get used to the old role and then it becomes a new one. Yes, as if it had been thrown in front of the foot. That's why I said it, chairman of the group. Thank you, I can get used to that. Our thanks certainly goes out to all the people who have worked with the coalition agreement. Because I have in the very beginning on the sidelines and later on the bodies can find out how much work that will be done there. And it has indeed cost a lot of free Saturday mornings. And yes, that is perhaps a little better for our parties to defend at home than for the people who have to do the work here. I have, and we as CDA neighbors, the conversations during the coalition negotiations as very pleasant experiences. And I have to say, I would almost say, I think it's a shame it's over, because I thought it was nice. And if something is cozy, it is also kosher, as the Jews can say so nicely. And there is actually no better word for it. I have noticed that we as parties, CDA was the smallest, if you look at this number of seats, that we have treated each other as equal and that each vote of all three parties, so also of the voters who voted for us, has been allowed to ring. And not only the votes of us, but also the votes of all parties that are here at the table. So we are very happy that we were able to experience that and that we were able to reach a very nice coalition agreement, as we see it. For the rest, I actually have to say thank you to the two outgoing legislators. I have experienced one less, but I have experienced the other very intensively. And I would almost like to say, Nico, thank you, if I may call you that, my political father in that sense. Because you have been able to guide me a bit in the whole process. I actually have nothing else to report. I would say I am happy with the agreement and I am curious what others think of it. Thank you. Thank you. Well, after the last one, we are all very curious. Because we have now heard the three forming parties, the coalition, the current coalition parties. But I would now like to give the floor to the VVD, Mr. Van Vierse. And I am curious how the VVD will judge this. Chairman. Let me start by complimenting the forming parties with a nicely balanced and not completely close-knit coalition agreement. We will be positively critical of the VVD when it comes to the implementation of this agreement. An agreement that we as a municipality can move forward with. Of course, there are things to be desired. The VVD would like to see a slightly more ambitious attitude of the new coalition, with regard to the number of houses to be built. The VVD thinks that 600 to 2026 is a bit on the lean side. If we want to achieve our goal of at least 1,400 houses in 2030, it is something that is a bit more promising. We will also be critical of ourselves when it comes to the future of the heat division. Are we really going to listen to our residents? Or do we as an organization gather residents around us as a conversation partner, who are already all in agreement on the course and the end result? Participation is a great asset, but we must also be prepared to direct it to other opinions. If we want to form working groups, soundboard groups or whatever we want to call those groups of talking residents, the organization will have to act on the diversity of opinions within that group. There is really one point in this agreement that the VVD cannot agree on. It is a fundamental point for the VVD that every resident of our municipality is equal, regardless of origin, ethnic background, ethnicity or religion. Agreement 4.9 from the coalition agreement undermines this equality by explicitly respecting the church and thus obligating anyone who does not join the church, to adapt to the church. This is a well-known fact for our group. We will then also issue an amendment to decision point 1 of the council decision, which I will read out now or at the next point. Then I will only read the dictum out. The council requests decision point 1 of the council decision as follows. To agree to a revised coalition agreement together with the neighbouring town hall tomorrow, 2022-2026, by 1. The sentence, we respect the church and later in that framework, to scrap space for measuring at the core under the head of the local economy. 2. To scrap agreement 4.9 and goes over to the order of the day. Thank you, chairman. Thank you. This amendment will receive the number A1. And is submitted by hand, so has arrived at the agreement 4. The floor is for the party of the working left, Mr. Marringa. Go ahead. Yes, thank you, chairman. First of all, congratulations to the coalition, the future coalition. We will still vote on the progress that has been made since the elections two and a half months. I am glad that we actually do not have to wait very long for that. Although I have made an attempt to put together a council-wide agreement, but fortunately we were able to come to the council a couple of times, where we have also made use of the grip. We liked that. That was on the content and not on the position. And I think we should have it in the coming years, especially at that level with each other. Anyway, congratulations, go ahead and do it. A brief reflection on the plans. I give the lead, we miss a few. You probably don't find it strange. It is a special time, outside. There are a number of crises going on. Corona is still around. It is still around. The corner it sometimes seems. Refugee crisis, but we miss the climate crisis. We miss the energy crisis. We miss the crisis in biodiversity. These are things that we really value. We have told you that. We are not only talking about today, and your program is about tomorrow, but we have it in a longer period. We have to make a huge turn with each other, also here. We will continue to ask you or all of us to pay more attention to that from the council. These are big assignments we are facing. Also in the coming weeks we have already talked about the environmental vision. How do we deal with our landscape, but with much more, with ourselves in fact. The GVVP will also be coming in the autumn. Recreation, tourism, all things that go about how we are going to deal with each other. And that look can sometimes come from different angles. And I greatly appreciate that there is at least the openness to dialogue with each other. I am not saying debate, we are doing debate here. Dialogue is about all of us. It is about society. So we are going on the road. We are going to work through knowledge-based work that is being developed. We are happy to participate in those conversations. But it is more than just talking or picking up. It is also doing. And I think that we see too little of that and perhaps too little for daring to let go. We would like to do everything ourselves. You have already indicated in your presentation that you want to put the power of society in it. I think we have to take a lot of steps in that. And not just going to arrange things from this point of view. For us, fittingly with our parties, everyone participates of great importance. These are uncertain times and I actually notice very little of that in the piece. We stand for everyone, everyone participates, but everyone can participate. We need everyone to take those steps to participate in the necessary transitions. Yes, give space, take space. I think that must be the balance we have been practicing with each other over the years. Because here, but especially outside, to go and do. Let's do that first. And then one small thing that is striking is that there is a family center. If you do that, for example, on housing construction, I think that we are one family home, that is out of time. Building target groups. I think it was in the newspaper last week that 41 people, or that it is one family, that people live alone. Those are the assignments, look differently than we have done so far. I hope that we will develop that with each other starting today in the next four years. In any case, good luck to all of us. Thank you. As the last speaker in this row, D66, Mrs. Schlusser. And with this we come to the sixth group, the seventh group is not represented. I said that at the beginning of the meeting. Thank you, chairman. Thank you to all those who have put a lot of effort into coming to this agreement that is now in front of us. I would like to go a little deeper on a few points. And I also have a number of questions for the formater, if that is allowed. In the fourth line you say you are going for an efficient and open management style. I assume that you want to implement the law Open Government and then especially in article 3.1. Active publicization as an obligation to relax. With the implementation of this law on May 1, young people, administrative transparency is increased to norm. So, for example, publicizing the notes of the college meeting would be a very good example of this. How do you plan to implement that law Open Government and that administrative culture? Another comment. In the last line there is a collaboration with the Council on the same subject. We ensure that neighbors will be dual municipalities. What do you mean by that? And why do you put this in this coalition agreement? What does that mean for the formation of the parties in this Council? Service provision. The neighborhood service provision can and still needs to be improved. It must be more accessible and more efficient. Digitalization will certainly help. We are concerned about those groups of people who are not so convenient digitally. Or because they do not have a computer or no internet or do not speak digitally. In our digital race to the future, we must ensure that we do not leave anyone behind. Participation. One of the key points in the coming years. It turns out to be a process of falling and rising. How do you do that together? How do you process your policies without misunderstandings or misinterpretations? We have seen that with the surrounding vision. We look forward to your start notification participation. Because together you can make great progress. Housing and housing development. We are very satisfied with the space for the flexible housing solution as Knaarhofjes, Tiny Houses and Flex Houses. D66 has been a warm advocate for years. Now that the dark clouds are over 600, already planned in the previous coalition period, new housing. I want to give you the opportunity to look at wood construction as an alternative. This gives room for discussion. Nature, landscape, environment, sustainability, climate adaptation. These are big files that have made a good start to the leadership of the parliament in recent years. Still, I miss the urgency in the short term. We live in neighborhoods as if nothing is at hand. So that we can say no to a simple pilot of windmills without blitz or blose. It is time to take big steps and we wish the new legislator a lot of success. I would like to enter this place on the developments of the holiday parks in the outer world. I give you a good example that it can also be different instead of the development that has taken place on the Loswal. Camping Oudorp in Zeeland has consciously chosen a different path, with the maintenance of the goods from the existing situation and not for unabated modernization through Chalets. We as municipalities must come up with solutions together with entrepreneurs that make it possible for them to say no to temporary offers. In the course of this week I will talk with members of other factions about an amendment that we will probably submit next week. Energy transition. You want to use solar panels and other innovative sustainable methods to generate energy. You are further excluding innovations on agricultural land. We find this very constructive. Would you also exclude an innovation if a vertical solar panel was now started in Culemore on agricultural land, where the cows grazed without any problems between the panels? What is your contribution to this? The mills. It is a nice thing to also subsidize the five mills that are not in the control of the municipality. It is difficult enough to keep historical mills. It is remarkable that we apparently find historical mills beautiful and modern not. I am curious how we will look at this in 100 years. The social domain. Enhance the family. A very special alinea, where we would like to have some clarification from you. What do you understand under family? Is that man, woman with children? Or are there also men and women with children, women and women with children? Or one older family under? As stated in the agreement, this is not clear to me and D66 finds this a core question. So we would like to have your answer on that. Finance. In the translation of the choices we see that this gives a discount of 300,000 euros. It is remarkable that last week I read in the press that the municipality has 4 million left. Then I wonder if we have made the right choices as a municipality last year, but that is for another time. I would like to conclude with a compliment about the last photo, the agreement at the bottom. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Schlusser. And with this, all the fractions have been on the table in the first term. I can imagine that the forming parties want to give a reaction. How do you want to do that? Do you want to give all three of them a part of the reaction? Do you want to discuss how you are going to do it? Or did you discuss this beforehand? Questions have been asked, especially by D66. Perhaps you also want to respond to the amendment that has been submitted. Yes, chairman, I don't have to be rude. I would like to give a first impression and I think my colleagues will do that too. There are also a number of interpretation questions, so it seems to me very good that each fraction responds to them separately. Then we will do that. Then we will just finish the fractions and then you will speak first to give a reaction. Go ahead. Yes, thank you. I will try. I will also do it in the order of speakers to give a reaction. First of all, to the VVD. Well, thank you for the compliments. I also have the conversations that we have had with you as very positive experiences. You give 600 homes, you find a little bit of ambition. I understand that. On the other hand, there are at least 600 homes. I very much hope that there will be more. Then we will do our best. What I have also indicated should be realistic. What we also see in the agreement, and I think I have indicated in my statement, should also be evaluated at times. Maybe there are bigger numbers possible. Participation. You are concerned about that, especially with the heat vision, we have indicated. But that concern is of course a little wider and that concern I also share with you. I think that is indeed a concern, that participation. And there is a new law coming up. Well, we have also written something about that in the coalition agreement. And if you have also read, I don't know which number agreement it is exactly. But we are also going to talk about that participation with each other and see what we understand below. And if you then, well, just as we are going to fight for everyone to feel heard, well, then we will certainly come across each other in a positive way. Then he has submitted an amendment. Yes, that amendment will not support our group. I understand your point of view, I respect your point of view. Politics is of course also the making of agreements and making compromises. Well, you know how we are in this group. That is simple enough. But we can with this, with this, with this agreement that we have here in the agreement, we can live well. We can explain that well. We have made an agreement with our coalition partners and that agreement is in good condition. A man, a man, a word, a word. We from the Green Left give a lot of work. Yes, they are there too. And well, there are many more that you also indicate. That is why one of the agreements that we also put in this agreement is that we have to talk to each other about the strategic tasks. In the past, as the municipal council, we have named six strategic tasks. Well, we have to look at each other. Are these tasks still the right ones? Do we have to make others of them? And I think we will come to talk about the themes that you mentioned there. Yes, you also mentioned that we want to do a lot ourselves. We want to do everything ourselves. Well, I think we have also written clearly about that participation and about the Rite Challenge, which was even a motion that our group has submitted. So, yes, we don't want that. We want to give residents much more opportunity to do things. For the rest, there are some interpretation differences of the agreement. I understand that, but we will undoubtedly talk about that in the coming years. Then this 60, which has indeed asked a number of questions, the one I have taken out and which I can answer at this moment, because for a number of I also just have to ... Well, that can't be done at the moment, but we will also come to that later in the period to talk about. About that open government law. Well, I think the open government law is very mandatory, in which a non-public must be made. I had to laugh a little bit. Today I happened to read a bit in the interior ministry and I don't know if you have read it too. About that public administration. I will read it out very briefly. The idea and purpose of the public administration is worth a lot. Unfortunately, the law will not work in practice as expected. Many articles within the public government are not yet fully developed and the practical availability is lacking. Because Plooi has not yet been reached, there is no more year plan and no planning set up for the active public and there is no access to temporary re-entry. And that is why the WHO misses the urgency. Due to the long training period and the lack of transmission to the new minister, it seems that the Ministry of Internal Affairs is not quickly realizing the new legislation. That is of course a concern that is there, which we share with each other, but we just have to meet the legal requirements as municipalities. So that is the point of view at the moment. The dual, why have we put it in this way and have we given it such important attention? For municipalities, dual relations between Council and College are very important. We find it very important that a legislator is a legislator of the entire Council. And that the Council also feels that the legislators are legislators of the entire Council. And that is why we have given it another attention. Look, the law of duality in municipalities is an old law, but it has also come about with falls and rises. We are developing this in this new way of working, in which we want to give each other much more space, I think dual management of great importance. Then he asked to protect the agricultural land. Yes, that is an important point for municipalities. And that is mainly about the flat solar panels, I will say. I am afraid of our neighboring municipalities, all those agricultural land that are provided with solar panels. While I think we as municipalities should also be very economical on that agricultural land, given all geopolitical developments. The main point that he himself has given. Those verticals, I have read a bit about it in the newspaper today, a very new development. We have to delve into it ourselves to talk about it further. But we will also continue to discuss sustainability. And then you ask what we understand about families. Well, our family is really not just a traditional family. Municipalities also have one old family or families with partners of the same gender. We follow the translation of the thick vandals for family. Thank you. With that you have done the first round of answers. Is there an introduction from the PCG? Go ahead. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I will start with Mrs. Slusse from D66. I was attracted by the strengthening of the family. An important point also for the PCG. And it's really not just about the traditional family formation as we know it. As I read in the coalition agreement, it also concerns the neighbors' vision of the child. So what was mainly central to us were his children and state. Also your group has been very constructive in the past to make those visions come true. And that has been our starting point. And what do we understand more about that? That we have to protect that. For example, by preventing certain advertisers from standing in our municipalities. That will ultimately put sustainable relations under pressure. That was mainly the point we found important. So that's why it was taken this way. Then I have the need, Speaker, to respond to the input from the VVD. Due to the subscription that has been submitted. And I want to divide that into two responses. And one is finally a reaction that concerns how our feelings are about it. With regard to our background, our group and me personally. Because everyone in the municipalities knows that the PCG is against any form of store opening on Sunday. The VVD itself can also know what they have in 2019, namely, still under consideration. And that we are against it, Madam Speaker, has nothing to do with having no respect for our neighbors. Or stimulating inequality, not necessarily. But that is because Sunday is a day of worship for us. Which calls us to be busy with things for God's kingdom. And that is precisely why those things lead to well-being for us and our neighbors. And the churches in our municipalities are the perfect example of what that means. Especially by the support and reception of Ukrainian war refugees. That is something I wanted to forget, Madam Speaker. Then I have a substantive political reaction when it comes to the submission of the VVD. I assume that every political party thinks that everyone living in the municipality is equal. Regardless of race, ethnicity, background, ethnicity or religion. This equality on the basis of mutual respect is very important for the PCG. And so we have also been constantly at the table as a forming party. That for the VVD every political choice is the greatest possible choice freedom of interest. And seen as liberal, we see that that does not mean that other points of view or life-threatening arguments must immediately be noted as unsupportable or disrespectful. And I mean that, Madam Speaker. From the point of view of the VVD, it seems that the Sunday rest cannot motivate from the perspective of life of some of our inhabitants, but that the abolition of that must be the right choice for neutrality and freedom. This is precisely the proof of disrespectful behavior and intolerance. I would like to call this amendment a symbolic policy. I'm going to interrupt you for a moment, because there is a question for you from Mr. Van Viersen. Chairman. It has just been said that what we say is actually a hook on equality and intolerance, was even mentioned. But I don't agree with that. If we just look technically at equality and we are going to respect the church, on Sunday we also have to respect the mosque on Friday afternoon and on Saturday the synagogue. Then all shops would be closed a lot more often, if that is the case. Thank you. I have not heard a question, but I assume you mean that. Do you think so too? I have not heard a question, but I assume that the question is about the mosque. We don't have a mosque in our municipality, but that has not been a question. I have labeled it as symbolic policy. I come to that with the following arguments. I find it very special that an agreement is amended. I didn't know it could be done, but it turns out to be possible. I have also had an explanation from our reverend. I would like to ask Mr. Verviersen, who I would like to answer at the end of my speech, why are you not choosing this? Why don't you do this later when there is a council proposal? The second point that is described in the considerations of the amendment suggests that residents or groups of people are not respected. I don't read anything about that in the coalition record. I don't read anywhere that people or children or whoever is excluded from, for example, care or WMO or social domain. On the contrary, I read the opposite. The third point, which I want to make when it comes to symbolic policy of this amendment, at the beginning of 2018, just before the election, the VVD initiated, despite the fact that there were agreements made within the coalition at that time, a change in the commitment to a full shopping order. To emphasize the word respect for each other once again, it is up to the VVD itself to make the balance of what it has delivered with the last elections. In short, the VVD would be eager to withdraw this amendment and to put their hands together and to strike together to pull together to seek the best for all our residents, with respect for each other's convictions. That is the task that we as representatives of the people must strive for. Thank you, Madam Speaker. It will be clear that we vote against the amendment. Thank you. I will give the floor to you shortly and then you may give your answer in the second term to the question you asked. CDA, Mr. Van Dijk, would you like to respond to the reactions of the other parties? Thank you, chairman. Most questions and points from the coalition agreement have already been answered. Thank you for the two speakers. In short, the VVD and GroenLinks, but also D66, have had a hole in the housing construction. The number is also answered, but it also has to do with the capacity of our municipality. We should not lose sight of that. We can say that we have 1,400 homes in four years, but it should also be processed. That is also one of the most important arguments to take up the 600 homes, because we would like to build real castles, not air castles. Then the point that has just been discussed a little bit, the Sunday rest. I can feel a bit with the VVD, I do understand the position of the VVD, but I would rather want to interpret it differently, because I just heard the VVD say that it is adapting to the church halls, we have to adapt to it. I would rather interpret it differently than let's keep in mind, let's keep in mind that we have to be together, we have to have points of view. I think we are a long way from our beautiful municipality. The points of the P of A GroenLinks, many of the points, I will not repeat them all, I have not written them all down, but they are almost all open points. We have already discussed them in our coalition negotiations and said, well, we leave that We leave it free in the Council. It may also be that we are not on the same page with three parties and that we vote differently. That is also the beauty of leaving it free in the Council. And maybe one last thing on D66 about strengthening the family. The question has actually already been answered, but I would actually like to say that the question has already been answered. Thank you, chairman. Thank you for this answer. And then I look around, because then we are now going to the second term. Then I can imagine that the VVD wants to react again. You were almost next to your chair. And there is also a question asked of you. May I also hear for a moment, does the PDR GroenLinks want to use the second term D66 too? Yes, fine. Then we just make the same round. Mr. Van Vierse, VVD, go ahead. Thank you, chairman. I actually want to say two things towards the PCG. You have taken the word respect in your mouth a number of times. I didn't do that today. I didn't do that in the amendment and didn't have respect in my statement. I had it about equality. And in my eyes it is a bit different, because I respect your decision. I respect your decision. I respect your decision. I respect your decision. I respect your decision. It is a bit different in my eyes, because I respect you very much. And I also respect the religion that you are building. I also want to state that a fundamental point can also lie outside a religion. We, the VVD, have a fundamental point in terms of equality. It would be a pity, because you just said that it is actually unexpected and that we may use a tool that you did not know it could use. But I think we have in that good conversation, which Mr. Van Alverd has already talked about a few times, we have literally said this to you. So I can't imagine that this has come as a surprise. And then towards the CDA I would like to say that... I'm going to ask you to speak through the chairman. Oh sorry. And then you can speak through the chairman. Please use the chair on the CDA. I was just on the wrong side. Excuse. I'm sorry. I have a question. We are not in agreement on this. It says here that we respect the church by limiting the opening hours on Sunday and holidays. So we are not in agreement on this. So if you are in favor of that, I would say that there is a mandate that you can support. Thank you, chairman. Yes, please stand for a moment, because there is another question for you from Mr. Zaaier. Go ahead. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I want to briefly listen to a few things. No one in the agreement, and not in my statement either, has discussed equality. Moreover, I have just kept a plea for it. And secondly, I could have known. You indeed indicated something during our consultation. We have experienced that very constructively. You were also clear about that. Certainly. I could have known that too, but I had actually hoped that you would not do it again from history. Because you yourself know how we are doing it. And you yourself know what is discussed here in the Council. How we have focused on this, and you have to address this, to think about it, to think of a solution for that together. Thank you. This will be the last answer. And then we close this debate. I just wanted to say, I will answer very briefly. Of course, I assume that you thought that, compared to us. But I can't see it any other way, that we also just have our principles. And those were not only clear to you, but we have also made them known separately. Thank you. Then I give the floor to the next speaker, the party of the Labor Green Left. I will just react very briefly. I think the conversation has started and then we will start the debate. Just compared to the amendment. When I saw it, I thought that the to We are also applying for such agreements. So it surprised me too, but apparently it can. We don't want to go along with that today. We see the proposals at the meeting. We will respond to that at that moment. This is a headline. As far as we are concerned, and I do want to mention that, is the diversity of society, of our communities, of great importance, as we will make the proposals. This is perhaps one of them, and we will also look at them. Because we have 15 villages and in those 15 villages all different people live. And that is important to us, that we take into account that with everyone. Thank you. D66, Ms. Schlusser. Are you going? Thank you, chairman. I want to respond to the amendment. I understand the point of view of the VVD, but I think that the coalition agreement gives room to make measures per core, so that there can be a regional view, say, can be looked at those opening times. And that entrepreneurs know best what is at their core for their wishes for the opening times. So we think it's a bit of a excessive amendment. I would put more the benefit or the doubt on the coalition agreement and expect the development of the whole. Thank you. I'm going to intervene now, because I don't want to repeat it. We have already heard a lot about this subject. So if you have anything new to report, it's fine. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to compliment colleague Marga on the correct summary of the diversity of all our core and what we should do with it. That's how we see it as PCG. That is very well summarized. Congratulations on that. Thank you. Mr. Van Vierse, also a new insight into this subject. Are you going? Certainly. Given the severe reaction to our amendment, which was actually not the underlying purpose, we will withdraw the amendment. Thank you. Thank you. What kind of appreciation do I hear? Mrs. Betting, you go ahead. You surprise me, but you go ahead. I heard Mr. Marringa say that we have 15 villages, but we have city neighborhoods. Aha, what about? We have a lot of villages and a very beautiful orange city. That's how it is. And we are all proud, I can say. Thank you. I'll take a look around at the end of the second term. And then we come to the vote. Then we close the consultation here. Then we move on to the vote. Has anyone after these extensive considerations still need a vote? Yes, and I can already see a hand. Mrs. Slussel, Mr. Van Vierse, you go ahead. Chairman, you will not be surprised, but we have just been turned a bit in the underlying consultation. We will first vote for the proposal, but we want to say once again that agreement 4.9, which concerns us, should not actually be included in the agreement. Thank you. Thank you for this vote. Mrs. Slussel, you go ahead. Yes, thank you, chairman. This is an agreement between three parties that are looking for our support tonight. We would also like to give that support as D66. Despite the fact that there are matters that we fundamentally disagree with, this is due to the ambitious level of sustainability, energy transition, climate adaptation and participation. But we want to make an important contribution as D66 in the next four years through positive input, perhaps with alternating majority, and together with neighbors tomorrow. Therefore, we would like to support that proposal 1-6. Thank you. I saw a hand at PCG. I haven't said anything yet, so I wanted to say something, if you think it's okay. I think you have already said a lot of words before. You have a vote, right? Yes, it is a vote. It goes over 4.9. I would first like to express respect for the three parties, how they have dealt with this point and how they ended up with this agreement. We have been involved in this in the past, but not now. But I would like to express my respect for that. I would like to make a point of this, but that would not be strange for those who have been in the Council for a long time, if it comes to the point that the opening hours on Sunday, the restrictions between 12 and 18 hours, I cannot agree with. That has to do with the fact that I find all restrictions on Sunday openings positive. I cannot agree with that, even if an opening is open for half a Sunday. I cannot agree with that. I cannot agree with that point, that sentence. I agree with that. Fine, thank you. Clear. Okay, thank you. Then we move on to the decision points themselves. Decision point 1, to agree with the coalition agreement. Decision 2, to adjust the next extra budgets for 2022 and to process them in the budget through the second bureau. This is about an account holder ODR, a formation of the second municipal BOA, expansion of the social domain formation and integral sports and health policy and updating the playground policy. And decision point 3, to determine the number of FTE legislators in 3.7 formation places and to process the costs in the budget through the second bureau. Then my question is, does anyone want vote on this? Then this whole proposal is unanimously accepted. Congratulations. Then I go a bit to the echoes, to Mr. Sightseer, tounting the two opposing legislatures , since there is a new agreement that is really starting to affair. We will have a goodbye on 16 June, which you have all been invited for. But we cannot just let this evening pass. We have had a nice look back at the last two years in the college this morning. That is of course special. More than two years, I must say. But usually, the municipal period lasts four years. That has not been the case here. At the end of 2019, a college broke down. And at the beginning of 2020, a new college was established. And the legislators Wiendels, Nico Wiendels and Andr\u00e9 van den Hurk were also part of that. That was a very strange time, I can tell you. I was not there yet, but I was in another municipality at that time. So I can imagine very well what happened here. A existing council with a new college was there for how many weeks? Seven weeks, eight weeks. And then corona started. So still in the white bread weeks, in the knowledge-making weeks, you suddenly started to meet all of them digitally. All knowledge-making agreements fell away. But also below, there was much less possibility for the regular contact you have in a college. It was even the case that when I came here in March the year after, I noticed that the college members had hardly any contact with each other privately. And that is unusual. In a college, you don't have to come to each other's floor every week, but you do talk about all kinds of private, personal things. And that was of course hardly ever the case here, because it was about work. The work was digital. And then I have to say, with this handicap, this college, two gentlemen behind me and two gentlemen in front of me, has done a great job. And now we are saying goodbye to two of them. You had, I'm just going to end with the yew, you had an ambitious programme for the past two years. I read it and I was amazed to see that you, together, with the Council, together, and I mean with everyone here, with the previous Council, have realized a lot of that agreement. And it was not a small agreement, I can tell you all. And it was also in a time when you could just talk very little with each other or just visit each other. You have achieved a lot, you have finished the whole programme. And if I look at the developments of the two legislators who are leaving now, then I'll start with Nico Wiendels. Nico, I have learned you as someone who reads very well, very precisely. You have a great sense of language and you also have a great sense of precision. It all has to be correct. And sometimes I think to a slight despair of some employees. But it has led to the improvement of many pieces, even to the College. Thank you for that. And you have done that out of an enormous commitment. I'll say a little more about that. You have the library riverland as a weapon to write about. You have as one of the first things, again sought access to this municipality at the library. And I know the Council was very happy about that. And especially the residents are very happy about it. You have made a lot of effort in the social domain. It is a difficult file, a large file, with enormous challenges. You have introduced a large programme. You have put in step by step, step by step, together with the department, you have always brought in improvements. And it is not yet, you are halfway through a programme. But I do see that enormous steps have been taken. And then I come back to your involvement. You were incredibly visible. You were very much along the line at sports competitions. You were present at presentations, music presentations, all kinds of other presentations. Because at some point, it was allowed again, for example, in the outdoor, Nico was always there. At volunteer associations, I met you. So you really showed the visibility. Then Andr\u00e9, what stands out to you is the cosiness. Talking to people, lighting a candle for people who have a hard time. And so people really put their hearts under the belt. I have appreciated that enormously. You are accessible, you are looking for residents. If they call you, you go immediately. You were also ready for your own party. That was also mentioned later, but I have also seen that. If there was a problem, then you were the first to be called. Very important, right? Then they thought, who do we have? We go to Andr\u00e9. And then you were there. Even if it was on an evening or on a weekend on Saturday. So that is really, I think, greatly appreciated from the party. And then in your subjects I call the environmental vision, where you have put a lot of work in, which will be in the council next week. The housing projects that have been drawn quickly. Yes, just been in order. And the execution is now coming. And the Rhine Bridge, which you have put in a lot of effort into. And unfortunately, it is still just as narrow as it was. But you have pulled it very hard. And for both of you, I have one last word. For both of you, you are both a core legislator, as this municipality needs you. You show yourself in the core. And you are secretly both CDA. We know one and the other is also. I thank you. I thank you very much for the cooperation and for your commitment. And you are doing well. Thank you. Well, then we will go back to the order of the day. That is agenda 3.2, the formation and appointment of the legislators. The formation we have just decided, the appointment of the legislators. Then I again give the floor to the gentlemen, look, the order. To the forming parties to their... No, I start with the religious letters. You started saying that, right? Yes, I was already corrected. I saw an restless movement and then I thought, I'm not doing something right. We start with the religious letters. There is a committee set up to know Mrs. Schlusser, Mr. Marenga and Mr. Van Vierse. And you have the religious letters judged together. And then would you like someone to give the floor to that? The chairman of Mrs. Schlusser. You may give the floor to the chairman. Yes, please. Thank you. At the council of the municipality of Buuren, the committee of research of the religious letters existing from the council members Van Vierse, Marenga and Schlusser, has turned over the submitted disclosures with regard to the election from 14 to 16 March 2022 and has conducted research on the religious letters and further on the election law. The research is conducted after the declaration of trend behavior, risk analysis integrity, clothing of public relations as far as this has not taken place at the appointment of council member in March 2022 and a declaration from the municipal base administration for as far as this has not taken place at the appointment of council member in March 2022. The religious letters have been submitted by the candidate legislators of the municipality. The two are Mr. Ka Mayag, Mrs. Em de Bas, Mr. JP Neve and Mrs. M Betink-Pierik. It turned out that the appointed to meet all the requirements. The committee shares with you that they have found the disclosures in order and the committee advises you to go over the appointment of the appointed. Thank you. Perhaps you have seen the very remarkable reader that in article 4 of the decision, or point 4 of the decision, was the submission of this committee. The committee has invited and put this committee to work, but it was still your formal task to make that decision. May I assume that you all agree with the submission of this committee? That is the case. Then the committee is set up with recurring force. It has done its job well this afternoon. So yes, here it was only with recurring force that was set up. Anyway, if someone had made a decision, we would have had another point. Then we have determined that the religious letters have been submitted in order, for which thanks for the work you have done this afternoon. Then we can now move on to the proposal of the legislators. Then I would like to give the floor to the group leaders of the coalition-leading parties to motivate which candidate they suggest why. First of all, the floor is for Mr Van Alfen, the mayor. I thought he was not ready at all, as if he was going to stand up, but he was. I am not very active, but I will quickly stand up. That is a contrast to the first candidate we would like to present. That is Mr Meijer, who is much more active than I was yesterday morning. We invited him to stand up at 6 am in Linden because he participated in the Europe Run. That was sporty on our side, but we could go home and he had to cycle a lot more. But he has done it, my compliments. Also to the children who have participated, so very good. As the first candidate we present Mr. Carl Meijer. Carl Meijer is not an unknown, he has been a legislator since 2020 on behalf of the municipality in the municipality of Buren. We present him for the portfolios in the main lines of finance and service. Yes, you all know him and we are very happy that he will continue in the coming period as a legislator. The second candidate we would like to present is a new candidate. That is Martine de Bas. There she is, experienced politician, experienced legislator, experienced in working with municipalities. She is going to live in portfolios and dress up as a sustainability. We are very happy that she has chosen to be a legislator with us. We think she fits this portfolio very well. We also think she fits very well within the way of work that we have described, that we have tried to determine in the coalition agreement, which we want to deal with in an open way, where we want to look for new forms of resident participation and where we want to involve all parties optimally. So in our opinion these are two very good, dual candidates. Thank you. The floor is yours, Mr. Zajer of the WCG. Thank you, Madam Speaker. We present Mr. Pieter Neven as legislator for the Council of the Municipalities of Buren with the portfolio Space and Traffic. Why are we doing this? Mr. Neven has been a legislator for more than six years, two years in our beautiful municipality of Buren. He has a large support area for all parties, the college and the organization, also external organizations, and takes his responsibility. And does this administrative responsibility also know good and correct separation of the political lines within the Council? And is a performance-oriented and has very high file knowledge? And besides, a nice person to deal with. That is certainly important too. Sometimes, but that is also such a departure, there are still some schoolmaster tendencies. But we will then also let him be positive. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Thank you. And third and last in this row is Mr. Van Dijk, CDA. Thank you, Speaker. We at CDA Buren want to present Ms. Bettin Pierik as legislator. And we do not do that for no reason. A small story before that. I am of course only here. I have been able to experience Monique as someone who can explain very clearly in very short terms what is going on. And I think that is very important. I have also been able to experience that she is very well in the Council and that she also gives a listening ear to everyone who has questions, problems or whatever. Monique's door is always open. And that is also very important as a legislator, that the door is always open for everyone, for the Council, but also certainly for the other apparatus, if I may put it that way, is very important. Because eventually we have to do it together, because together we are neighbors. I have noticed that Monique, if I may say yes, has enormous knowledge of dossiers. And in the three-year-low council membership she has, all dossiers that now come by, that have ever played, she knows exactly the hat and the edge. And if she has one dossier knowledge, then I think that is Monique at the top. And I think she can fulfill the task as a legislator very well. Thank you. Thank you for this beautiful introduction. Then I can say about the integrity survey that has taken place in recent weeks with the cooperation of the four appointed legislators. There are the reports of known, also read and approved by the legislators themselves, and there is no hindrance or injury for your appointment. So we come to the conclusion that four legislators are being presented that the Bureau Berenschot, what the integrity survey has done, to this outcome and that the religious letters have been found to be correct. Then I come to the question, has anyone, after the introduction and presentation, asked? That is not the case. Then we come to the moment of vote. Then the question to you, does anyone want a vote? If so, then we go over to a written vote. You know that, right? Does anyone want a vote? That is not the case. I saw you still whispering, that is not the case. Then we can determine that the four legislators are unanimously adopted by this Council. Then we can proceed to the approval, to the acceptance of the appointment. I'm going to take a look at the graph. Then I'm going to ask you all four to come forward here. Then you get a microphone, but you can stand next to each other. Thank you. I declare that I, to be appointed to the court, on the right hand side, under any name or any gift or any promise, have taken or will take. I declare and promise that I, to do or to leave something out of this office, have or will take any gift or any promise on the right hand side. I promise that I will be loyal to the Constitution, that I will follow the laws and that I will fulfill my duties as a legislator after honor and conscience. And then you may answer with that declaration and promise. That declaration and promise. For the three of you I will read out the EET and then you may answer in turn. I declare that I, to be appointed to the court, on the right hand side, under any name or any gift or any promise, have taken or will take. I declare that I, to do or to leave something out of this office, on the right hand side, have taken or will take any gift or any promise. I declare that I will be loyal to the Constitution, that I will follow the laws and that I will fulfill my duties as a legislator after honor and conscience. So truly my God helps all powerful. So truly my God helps all powerful. So truly my God helps all powerful. Thank you. You are all honored. Congratulations. Congratulations. You will receive a flower. How do you do this? I will put this away. And this one too. ? Then we will focus on the next agenda item, two agenda items. I will take them with me. Mrs. Betting-Pierink has left the Council and is now a lawmaker, so there is a place holiday at the CDA. A new council member has been proposed. The faith letters are also checked by the same committee, which you may now report. The report goes first to Mr. Van Blijderveen. That is all. No report. Only one report. Yes, fortunately. The statement of the Commission on the Research of the Faith Letters to Councilmembers. At the Council of the Municipal Municipalities, the Commission on the Research of the Faith Letters consisting of the Councilmembers Marga van Vierse and Schlusser has turned over the submitted disclosures, with regard to the election from 14 to 16 March 2022, and has the research directed to the faith letters and further to the election law. The research is directed to the application of the appointment, dressing up for public relations and for new council members, a statement from the municipal base administration. The faith letters have been submitted by the Council of the Municipal Municipalities, appointed by the Council of the Municipalities on 7 June 2022. It has been revealed that the appointed person meets all the requirements. The Commission shares with you that they have found the disclosures in order, and the Commission advises you to go over the appointment of the appointed person. Thank you, Mrs. Schlusser. Then the question to the Council. Having heard this, can you agree with the appointment of Mr. Van Blijderveen as a council member or does someone here want a vote? The question is, can you vote? Thank you. Mr. Van Blijderveen, I can now give you your approval. You can put the food down. You may, there is an official photographer in the room. Mr. Van Blijderveen, you say, I swear that I, to be appointed as a council member, have given or promised any gift or favour, righteously, or in the name of any wish, I swear that I, to do or leave something in this office, have or will take any gift or promise, righteously or in the name of any wish, I swear that I will be loyal to the Constitution, that I will follow the laws and that I will fulfil my duty as a council member to honor and conscience. God help me almighty. Congratulations. Thank you. Mr. Van der Sluis, would you like to come forward? Yes, I will appoint you as a council member. The Council has no say in this. I will appoint you as a citizen-race member. I can ask you, if someone has a say in the Council, but you are not going to talk about it. So I will... Yes, you may all stand up again. You have to stand up. It's not about you, but you have to stand up. I hope you're wearing a mask. I will read out the eid for you and you may answer that. I swear that I, to be appointed as a citizen-race member, righteously or in the name of any wish, I have given or promised any gift or promise. I swear that I, to do or leave something in this office, righteously or in the name of any wish, I have or will take any gift or promise. I swear that I will be loyal to the Constitution, that I will follow the laws and that I will fulfil my duties as a citizen-race member after honor and conscience. May God bless you. Congratulations. Let's have a look at this. Thank you. Do what you think is right. We have all issued the official actions. Everyone has been appointed. The coalition agreement has been adopted. Congratulations. I will conclude with a short summary of the evaluation and summary of what I have seen. But I will do that first. Mr. Van Vierse, if you want to make a comment or a round question, please go ahead. Thank you, chairman. If you, as a citizen-race member, hold a speech for the first time, it is called your speech, and people applaud. In this case, I wanted to say something about our citizens' rights. We will come to the end of this meeting. Congratulations to the legislators and the citizens' council. I want to look back at what we heard tonight. You have signed a beautiful agreement. You agree on that. I think it is good to see, hear and feel the story. I feel that you are all going for this. It is widely carried out, but you also have the intention to take the next steps together. Out of the main parts, there are three that I would like to mention. I think we really have to think about this in the coming time. Of course, of everything. But from the point of view of the council, I think modern management is a point where we are all busy with the old council and with the new council. The vision of the future, phase one and phase two, is determined by the previous council. But it is up to you now, and that has already been said tonight, to take a path together. That vision of the future for the people who listen, watch or are present here, is an important path. The council has looked at what kind of municipality we want to be in the coming years. It has been said that the council wants to be a municipality of growth and modest growth. Growth, we have heard about it all, new homes, more residents, perhaps, growth of companies, modest growth, modest innovation. We also want, and the council has added, we want growth and modest growth, we want to preserve cultural history, we want to preserve our beautiful space. That is still a task, of course. You will work very hard together in the coming years. What you want to do next, and I will also tell the public, you also want to work together as a council, as a municipality. You want to work together with your residents. You want to work together with the college and you want to work together with the organization. And that path, how are we going to do that together? That is a very important path that we are going to fill with each other in the coming years. And I am looking forward to it. I am looking forward to this council, which is so eager to get to work. And with this college, which is completely ready to get to work. Tomorrow, the end of the afternoon, so it will take another 24 hours, we will definitely establish the portfolio distribution with each other. I see a more important approach and we have already had a few talks about it, so I think there will be a nice portfolio distribution, where we will all have our hands full, where you will all have your hands full, but what I also see of it, we are looking forward to it. We have already met each other in the last few days, we have made a beginning, but we are looking forward to it, we are going to make a good time, with the council, with the organization, with the residents and with each other. I wish us all, all of you, a lot of success. And I thank you for this beautiful evening. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
